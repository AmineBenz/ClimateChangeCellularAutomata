# ClimateChangeCellularAutomata

This is a small University Homework made in Java Repast3 in Eclipse by :
    - Benzagouta Mohamed Lamine (AmineBenz)
    - Bounaghla Soheyb
    
The goal is to simulate Co2 emission and propogation using Cellular Automata and Multi Agent Simulation.
The screen is divided in 4 areas, the sky on top, the land on the right, sea on the left and the desert on the bottom.
there are four agents :
  1- Cars, they move, avoid other agents and emit Co2.
  2- Factories, they can't move but emit Co2.
  3- Trees, don't move and consume Co2.
  4- People, just stand still.
  
Once produced, Co2 propagates through the cells (red color) if it hits a tree it gets consumed by a value.
All used values are adjustable in the parameters panel (in French though)
